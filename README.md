In this portfolio, I tried data processing, exploration and manipulation, and made the following visualizations:
- Data Collection: Utilized programming techniques to systematically gather data from various sources.
- Exploration and Manipulation: Employed the pandas library in Python to explore, assess, and manipulate the collected data. This involved tasks such as cleaning data, handling missing values, and transforming datasets to facilitate analysis.
- Creating Engaging Visualizations: Leveraged pandas' capabilities to create visually appealing tables that effectively summarize and present key insights from the processed data.

**On the dashboard that I have created, you can find some information about bike riders in London, such as the number of riders in a few days/weeks/months, temperature, wind speed, weather, riding time and so on. From the visualization, the information can be used for certain purposes, such as companies, organizations, governments, or for personal use.. Thank you, and I hope it proves beneficial to you.**
